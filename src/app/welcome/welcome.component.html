    Welcome to the ParrotCrawl the only web crawler inspired by
    the Cult of the Parrot.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use ParrotCrawl, enter a URL you would like to start from.
    The crawler will search outward from that webpage, navigating
    through each link.
  </p>
 <p>
   If you would like the ParrotCrawl to search for a string on the
   pages it visits, enter it in the optional field. You will also
   need to choose a value of <i>n</i> which will determine how many
   links from the original URL that the search will continue for.
   You must also choose a style of search: either depth-first or
   breadth-first. The depth-first search will choose links randomly
   and continue until <i>n</i> is reached. The breadth-first search
   will navigate through a limited number of links on each webpage
   and then navigate through the links on each of those pages until
   the depth of <i>n</i> is reached.
 </p>
  <p>
    If you choose to use breadth-first, please note that for each
    value of <i>n</i> a different number of links per webpage searched
    will be returned. For <i>n</i> = 1 the max is 1000 links returned
    from the URL you have given. For <i>n</i> = 2 the max is 30 links
    returned per webpage navigated to. For <i>n</i> = 3 the max is 10
    links returned per webpage navigated to. For <i>n</i> = 4 the max
    is 5 links returned per webpage navigated to.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once on the results page, nodes in <span class="redText">red</span>
   indicate dead links, and nodes in <span class="greenText">green</span>
   indicate that your optional search phrase appeared on that page.
  </p>
  <p>Please note that if you are using a web shield or other similar
    antivirus software, you may receive errors on searches that take
    a while to complete.
