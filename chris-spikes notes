Angular ParrotSearch Service:
-Branched master branch to chris-spikes
-Used angular cmd line to generate a new service, ParrotSearchService, held in ./src/app
-This service will wrap an HTTP request (to the node server) in a nice package.
  -Using example from this site: https://www.concretepage.com/angular/angular-httpclient-post
  -Also using guide at https://angular.io/guide/http#making-a-post-request

-The form held at ./src/app/home/home.component.html needs to be injected with this service
