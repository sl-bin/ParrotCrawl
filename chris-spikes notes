Angular ParrotSearch Service:
-Branched master branch to chris-spikes
-Used angular cmd line to generate a new service, ParrotSearchService, held in ./src/app
-Created parrotSearch object defined at ./src/parrotSearch
-Import this object to ParrotSearchService
-This service will wrap an HTTP request (to the node server) in a nice package.
  -Using example from this site: https://www.concretepage.com/angular/angular-httpclient-post
  -Also using guide at https://angular.io/guide/http#making-a-post-request
-The form held at ./src/app/home/home.component.html needs to be injected with this service

Angular Home component
-Need to inject the ParrotSearchService into home.component.ts so that the form at home.component.html can have a route for the POST to be sent.
  -Import parrotSearch object
  -Import ParrotSearchService
-Cannot figure out how to structure form in home.component.html to send POST to the search(); function in home.component.ts
  -Will ask Charles for help with this.

Node server to accept POST request.
Following guide at https://malcoded.com/posts/angular-backend-express
-Created node file called parrotServe.js at ./parrotServe.js
-Route at /api/search accepts POST request, and prints out the values to console
-Can send back a 200 'OK' and any other data we choose (likely the search results)
