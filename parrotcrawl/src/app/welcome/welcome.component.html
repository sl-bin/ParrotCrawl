    Welcome to the ParrotCrawler the only web crawler inspired by
    the Cult of the Parrot. <img src="./assets/middleparrot.gif"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    To use the ParrotCrawler enter a url you would like to start
    from and the crawler will search outward from that website
    navigating through each link. If you would like the
    ParrotCrawler to search for a string on the pages it visits
    enter it in the optional field. You will also need to choose
    a value of <i>n</i> which will determine how many links from
    the URL you have entered the search will continue. You must
    also choose a style of search, either depth first or breadth
    first. The depth first will choose links randomly and continue
    until either <i>n</i> is reached or the optional search value
    is found. To start click the 'get started' button!
